Introduction
The sales prediction project aims to help BigMart make data-driven decisions and optimize their stocking and inventory management processes. By accurately forecasting the sales, BigMart can ensure that they have the right amount of each product in stock, reducing wastage and maximizing profitability.

In this project, we develop a machine learning model that predicts the sales based on historical data. We explore various features such as product attributes, store details, and historical sales patterns to build an effective predictive model.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is provided by BigMart and contains historical sales data for various products across different stores. It consists of the following columns:

Item_Identifier: Unique identifier for each product
Item_Weight: Weight of the product
Item_Fat_Content: Categorical variable indicating the fat content of the product
Item_Visibility: Percentage of total display area in the store allocated to the product
Item_Type: Categorical variable indicating the category of the product
Item_MRP: Maximum Retail Price (price at which the product is sold)
Outlet_Identifier: Unique identifier for each store
Outlet_Establishment_Year: Year of establishment of the store
Outlet_Size: Categorical variable indicating the size of the store
Outlet_Location_Type: Categorical variable indicating the type of location where the store is situated
Outlet_Type: Categorical variable indicating whether the store is a grocery store or a supermarket
Item_Outlet_Sales: Sales of the product in the store (target variable)
Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to run the code:

Python 3.x
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine.

Install the required dependencies using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To use the sales prediction model, follow these steps:

Prepare your dataset in the same format as the provided dataset.

Place your dataset file in the data directory.

Run the predict_sales.py script:

bash
Copy code
python predict_sales.py
The script will load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the model, and make predictions for the test data.

The predicted sales will be saved in a CSV file named predicted_sales.csv.

Model Development
The model.ipynb notebook contains the step-by-step process of developing the sales prediction model. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.

Evaluation
The model performance is evaluated using various metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared score. These metrics provide insights into how well the model performs in predicting the sales.

Results
The results of the sales prediction model are summarized in the results.md file. It includes the evaluation metrics and insights derived from the model's performance
